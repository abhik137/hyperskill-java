# Numeral System Converter

## Stage 1/6: For example

### Description

In this project, you will be creating your own numeral system converter. If you don't know what a numeral system is, or simply need to brush up on the topic, browse through the relevant [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system) page. Also, there is a [great Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2zsmYaI5ww) that explains various numeral systems and the relationship between them.

Implement a program that outputs a number in two systems: the first is decimal, and the second one is binary. This must be the same number represented in different systems; feel free to choose any number you like.

This stage is auto-graded. The grader will check that:

- you output a single line;
- there are two numbers;
- the first number is decimal;
- the second number is binary (it starts with 0b and contains only 0 and 1);
- the first number is equal to the second one.

Note that you do not need to enter anything into the program, you should print a line prepared in advance. A single String is expected to be printed.

### Example

Example 1:

```text
10 = 0b1010
```

Example 2:

```text
2 is equal to 0b10
```

## Stage 2/6: For example

### Description

Implement a program that calculates **the last digit** of the given number converted to base 8.

This stage is auto-graded. The grader will **input a number** in base 10, and then check that your program **output** matches the correct answer.

### Example

Example 1

Input:
```text
8
```

Output:

```text
0
```

Example 2
